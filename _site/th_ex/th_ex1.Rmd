# Overview

In this take-home exercise, appropriate static statistical graphics methods are used to reveal the demographic of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA. 

The data should be processed by using appropriate tidyverse family of packages and the statistical graphics must be prepared using ggplot2 and its extensions.

# Getting Started

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# Importing Data

The code chunk below import *Exam_data.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package and save it as an tibble data frame called *exam_data*.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```


# A Simple Bar Chart

The code chunk below plot a bar chart by using geom_bar() of ggplot2.


```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = GENDER)) +
  geom_bar()
```
